During development, break complex UIs into smaller, reusable components to avoid deeply nested JSX structures.  
Even within a single page (route), create additional smaller files or subcomponents to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

Modularizing large components into multiple files improves clarity, simplifies future updates or refactors, and enhances long-term scalability.
